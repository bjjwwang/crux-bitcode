POST-INSTALL:

Rules are no longer included with SpamAssassin "out of the box".  You will
need to immediately run "sa-update", or download the additional rules .tgz
package and run "sa-update --install" with it, to get a ruleset.

Be careful to run sa-update before calling /etc/rc.d/spamassassin. Otherwise
you may receive this error:

child process [1101] exited or timed out without signaling production of a PID
file: exit 255 at /usr/bin/spamd line 2588.

in this case remove the /tmp/spamd-*-init directories, run sa-update and only
after that start spamassassin.
