My apache config looks like this:

    Alias /trac/ "/usr/share/trac/htdocs/"
    <Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">
        SetEnv TRAC_DB "/var/lib/trac/trac.db"

    # You need something like this to authenticate users
    <Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/login">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "svnjw"
        AuthUserFile /somewhere/trac.htpasswd
        Require valid-user
    </Location>

Adjust AuthUserFile to your needs
